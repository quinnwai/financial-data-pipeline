# Financial Data Pipeline

## About
Here is a static version of the script I used to automate a financial data pipeline within Google Sheets for LaunchCode. The main problem was that automating finacial data was very manual and time-consuming, as profit and loss data was constantly being updated even after the end of a company deal. This script provides a some UI functionality within the financial data sheet as well as tags the profit and loss data by training course ID.
